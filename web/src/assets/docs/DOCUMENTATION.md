# Introduction

Welcome to [nest.land](https://nest.land)!

Nest.land is a first-of-its-kind decentralized module registry and CDN built for [Deno](https://deno.land).

Using the power of blockchain, you can publish your Deno modules to the [Arweave Permaweb](https://www.arweave.org/) through nest.land, where they can **never** be deleted. With this feature, you can make sure that your users will always have the required resources for their projects, via Deno's web-based module imports. 

# Installation

To initialize and publish your first module to nest.land, you will need our CLI, **eggs**. You can install it using this command:

```shell script
deno install -A -f --unstable -n eggs https://x.nest.land/eggs@0.1.8/mod.ts
```
Please make sure to use the `-A` flag to grant all permissions to eggs, so you can enjoy all features seamlessly.
> Note: You need to upgrade to Deno v1.1.0 or newer in order to use our CLI.

# Linking your API key

In order to publish modules to the blockchain with our CLI, you must first generate an API key. See [Getting Started](/#start).

After you generate your API key, you need to add it in the CLI. To do this, type:
```shell script
eggs link --key [your key]
```

# Initializing a module

You'll need to initialize a module with eggs in order to publish it. To do this, you need to type the following command in the root directory of your project:
```shell script
eggs init
```
By doing this, you'll be prompted with a setup screen, where you will be asked to enter:
#### module name
The name of your new module
#### module description
The description of your new module
#### Is this a stable version?
Whether the current version of your module is stable or not. You will be able to update this with each new publish
#### Enter the files and relative directories that nest.land will publish separated by a comma.
All the files you want to publish with your module. You should include your README.md file here next to all the imported / required files of your module. 

#### Config format
Choose between your preffered config format among yaml and json.

# Configuration

After you've initialized a project, you'll see a brand new `egg.json` or `egg.yml` file depending on the config format you've chosen. This file is specific to nest.land and needed for the registry.
> Note: `egg.json` is different than Node's `package.json` for several reasons! [Here is why](https://github.com/nestlandofficial/nest.land/issues/52#issuecomment-643038042).

Here is a template egg configuration file with all available fields:

__JSON__:
```json
{
    "name": "module-name",
    "description": "Your brief module description",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "entry": "./src/main.ts",
    "stable": true,
    "unlisted": false,
    "fmt": true,
    "repository": "https://github.com/your_name/your_project",
    "files": [
        "./mod.ts",
        "./src/**/*",
        "./README.md"
    ]
}
```

__YAML__:
```yaml
name: package-name
description: Your brief package description
version: 0.0.1
entry: ./src/main.ts
stable: true
unlisted: false

# Publishing a module

To publish a module, just navigate to the root of your module and use the command shown:
```shell script
eggs publish
```
Boom! After this, you'll be returned a link to your module on our [Gallery](gallery).

> Note: The same command is used to publish a new version to an existing module!

## Badge

In addition, you'll have the option of adding our official badge to your project docs, courtesy of [@maximousblk](https://github.com/maximousblk). This is the best way you can support our registry and help us grow. We'd really appreciate seeing it on your project!

or if you want to support us *louder*, you can use the large badge.

# Updating all of your dependencies

Updating your dependencies is a breeze thanks to [our contributors](https://github.com/nestlandofficial/nest.land/graphs/contributors). Just type the command shown to automatically check for and update all module imports. Not only does this update nest.land modules, but it can also update [deno.land/std](https://deno.land/std/), [deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x/), [github](https://github.com/topics/deno) and [denopkg.com](https://denopkg.com/) modules!

```shell script
eggs update http fs // update fs and http in default deps.ts
```

```shell script
eggs update --file file.ts // update all in file.ts
```

```shell script
eggs update http fs --file file.ts // use specified file and modules
```

```shell script
eggs update -g denon // update script installed with "eggs install"
```

More detailed information about this service is available on our CLI [README](https://github.com/nestlandofficial/nest.land/tree/master/eggs).

# Installing a script as an executable

Just like *deno install*, you can install modules globally with eggs. By installing it this way, you will be notified if an update is available for your module. 

To install a module, simply replace *deno* with *eggs*.

```shell script
eggs install --allow-read --allow-run --allow-write --allow-net --unstable https://x.nest.land/denon@2.2.0/denon.ts
```

# Upgrade eggs

To upgrade the eggs CLI, use the command shown:

```shell script
eggs upgrade
```
